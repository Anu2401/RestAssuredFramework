# RestAssuredFramework

Welcome to the Github repository for the Rest Assured framework!

This repository contains a project showcasing data-driven and keyword-driven test cases using the Rest Assured framework.
Rest Assured is a powerful testing framework for RESTful APIs that allows you to easily write and execute automated tests for your API endpoints.

In the src/test/java directory, you will find the following Automation Methods:

Data Driven: 
This contains data-driven test cases for a sample API endpoint using Rest Assured.
The test data is stored in a CSV file, and the tests are executed for each row in the file.

Keyword Driven: 
This contains keyword-driven test cases for the same sample API endpoint.
The tests are written using a simple keyword-based syntax and executed using Rest Assured.
In addition to the test cases, this demo project includes configuration files and utilities to help you get started with Rest Assured.

I hope you find this project useful for learning and using Rest Assured for testing your APIs.
Please feel free to contribute to the project or raise any issues you encounter.

HappyÂ testing!
